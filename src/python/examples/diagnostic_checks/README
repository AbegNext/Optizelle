In the following example, we show how to setup a vector space and define
functions for optimization.  Then, we pass these specifications into
the diagnostic checks for peopt.  In these checks, we conduct a number
of finite difference tests in addition to symmetry tests of different
operators.  In order to run the example, execute ./run.sh.
