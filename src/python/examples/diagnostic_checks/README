In the following example, we show how to setup a vector space and define
functions for optimization.  Then, we pass these specifications into
the diagnostic checks for Optizelle.  In these checks, we conduct a number
of finite difference tests in addition to symmetry tests of different
operators.  In order to run the example, call

    python2.7 driver.py
    
Alternatively, if the PYTHONPATH does not include Optizelle, call

    PYTHONPATH="../.." python2.7 driver.py
