In this example, we show how to setup and run the simple inequality
constrained optimization problem

min (x+1)^2+(y+1)^2 st x + 2y >= 1, 2x + y >=1

In order to run the problem, call

    python2.7 driver.py
    
Alternatively, if the PYTHONPATH does not include Optizelle, call

    PYTHONPATH="../.." python2.7 driver.py
