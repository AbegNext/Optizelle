In this example, we show how to setup and run a simple optimization
problem.  Here, we minimize the Rosenbrock function, 

f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100(y-x^2)^2.

In order to run the problem, call

    python2.7 driver.py
    
Alternatively, if the PYTHONPATH does not include peopt, call

    PYTHONPATH="../.." python2.7 driver.py

Now, in order to modify the algorithm, we modify the run.peopt parameter file.
In this file, we see several sections such as "peopt", "peopt_TR_Newton", and
so on.  The only section read by peopt is the "peopt" section.  The other
section are different ways of modifying the optimization algorithm and are
present as comments.  In other words, in order to change the algorithm, copy
one of the other sections into the "peopt" section.
