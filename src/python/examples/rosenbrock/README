In this example, we show how to setup and run a simple optimization
problem.  Here, we minimize the Rosenbrock function, 

f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100(y-x^2)^2.

In order to run the problem, call ./run.sh.  Now, in order to modify
the algorithm, we modify the run.peopt parameter file.  In this file,
we see several sections such as "peopt", "peopt_TR_Newton", and so on.  The
only section read by peopt is the "peopt" section.  The other section
are different ways of modifying the optimization algorithm and are present
as comments.  In other words, in order to change the algorithm, copy one
of the other sections into the "peopt" section.
