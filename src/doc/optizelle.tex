\chapter{Introduction}

        Optizelle [op-t\textit{\!uh}-{\bf zel}] is an open source software library designed to solve general purpose nonlinear optimization problems of the form
    \begin{lrbox}{\boxUnconstrained}
        $\begin{array}[t]{rcl}
            \min\limits_{x\in X} && f(x)
        \end{array}$
    \end{lrbox}
    \begin{lrbox}{\boxEqualityConstrained}
        $\begin{array}[t]{rcl}
            \min\limits_{x\in X} && f(x)\\
            \st && g(x)=0
        \end{array}$
    \end{lrbox}
    \begin{lrbox}{\boxInequalityConstrained}
        $\begin{array}[t]{rcl}
            \min\limits_{x\in X} && f(x)\\
            \st && h(x)\succeq 0
        \end{array}$
    \end{lrbox}
    \begin{lrbox}{\boxConstrained}
        $\begin{array}[t]{rcl}
            \min\limits_{x\in X} && f(x)\\
            \st && g(x)=0\\
                && h(x)\succeq 0
        \end{array}$
    \end{lrbox}
    \begin{lrbox}{\boxOptimizationTypes}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
            \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Unconstrained} &
            \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\bf Equality Constrained}\\

\noindent It features 
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf State of the art algorithms}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unconstrained -- Steepest Descent, Preconditioned Nonlinear-CG (Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, Hestenes-Stiefel), BFGS, Newton-CG, SR1, Trust-Region Newton (Truncated-CG and Truncated-MINRES), Barzilai-Borwein Two-Point Approximation.
            \item Equality Constrained -- Inexact Composite Step SQP.
            \item Inequality Constrained -- Primal-Dual Interior Point Method for Cone Constraints (Linear, Second-Order Cone, and Semidefinite), Log-Barrier Method for Cone Constraints.
            \item Constrained -- Any combination of the above.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf Open source}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Released under the 2-Clause BSD License.
            \item Free and ready to use with both open and closed sourced commericial codes.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf Multilanguage support}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Interfaces to C++, MATLAB/Octave, and Python.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf Robust computations and repeatibility}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can stop, archive, and restart the computation from any optimization iteration.
            \item Combined with the multilanguage support, the optimization can be started in one language and migrated to another.  For example, archived optimization runs that started in MATLAB can be migrated and completed in C++.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf User-defined parallelism}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Fully compatible with OpenMP, MPI, or GPUs.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf Extensible linear algebra}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Supports user-defined vector algebra and preconditioners.
            \item Enables sparse, dense, and matrix-free computations.
            \item Ability to define custom inner products and compatibility with preconditioners such as algebraic multigrid make Optizelle well-suited for PDE constrained optimization.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf Sophisticated Control of the Optimization Algorithms}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Allows the user to insert arbitrary code into the optimization algorithm, which enables custom heuristics to be embedded without modifying the source.  For example, in signal processing applications, the optimization iterates could be run through a band-pass filter at the end of each optimization iteration.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Brief Example}

        In order to see a short example of Optizelle in action, consider the unconstrained minimization of the Rosenbrock function
$$
    \begin{array}{rcl}
        \min\limits_{x\in\re^2} && (1-x_1)^2+100(x_2-x_1^2)^2.
    \end{array}
$$
In order to optimize this function, we use the following code and parameters, which generates the subsequent output.

\section{History}

        Optizelle originated in 2010 as a code called PEOpt (Parameter Estimation Using Optimization) written by Joseph Young at Sandia National Laboratories.  There, it was used as the comptuational driver for a variety of both internal and external customers.  Due to the scale of the problems involved and the nuances of high-performance computing environments, PEOpt was designed specifically to integrate with large, existing code bases as quickly and unobtrusively as possible.  Later, Sandia approved the open source release of PEOpt on two separate occasions in 2012 and 2013 under the 2-Clause BSD License.  It was from this released code that Joseph continued work on Optizelle through a new company called OptimoJoe.
        
\chapter{Installation}\label{ch:Install}

        In the following chapter, we discuss how to download, build, and incorporate Optizelle into a new project.

\section{Downloading}

        Optizelle can be downloaded from
\begin{center}
    \mbox{\url{http://www.optimojoe.com/optizelle}}
\end{center}
as a zipped archive.  Here, we also provide direct access to our source code repository.

\section{Dependencies}

        Optizelle depends on the following software packages
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|p{.5\textwidth}|}\hline
{\bf Dependency} & {\bf Version} & {\bf Optional?} & {\bf Purpose} \\\hline
\hyperref[tbl:compilers]{C++11} & & No & Compilation of the core library\\\hline
\hyperref[tbl:compilers]{FORTRAN 77} & & No & Determines the name mangling scheme for BLAS and LAPACK\\\hline
\href{http://cmake.org}{CMake} & $\geq$ 2.8.9 & No & Build system\\\hline
\hyperref[tbl:make]{Make} & & No & Build system\\\hline
\href{http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net}{JsonCpp} & $\geq$ 0.6.0-rc2 & No & Parsing of the configuration files and the default archive/restart engine\\\hline
\hyperref[tbl:blaslapack]{BLAS and LAPACK} & & No & Dense kernels for the default vector spaces in the C++ interface\\\hline
\href{http://www.ctan.org}{pdflatex} & & Yes & Documentation generation \\\hline
\href{http://python.org}{Python} & 2.7.x & Yes & Python interface \\\hline
\href{http://www.numpy.org}{NumPy} & $\geq$ 1.8 & Yes & Dense kernels for the default vector spaces in the Python interface\\\hline
\href{https://www.gnu.org/software/octave}{Octave} & & Yes & MATLAB/Octave interface\\\hline
\href{http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab}{MATLAB} & & Yes & MATLAB/Octave interface\\\hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}

        As far as C++11 and FORTRAN 77 compilers, in theory, any valid compiler should work.  A small list of these compilers is
\phantomsection\label{tbl:compilers}
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}\hline
{\bf Compiler} & {\bf Version} & {\bf Language} & {\bf Platform}\\\hline
\href{http://gcc.gnu.org}{GCC} & $\geq 4.7$ & C++11, FORTRAN 77 & Linux, Unix, OS X \\\hline
\href{http://clang.llvm.org}{Clang} & & C++11 & Linux, Unix, OS X \\\hline
\href{http://dragonegg.llvm.org}{DragonEgg} & & C++11, FORTRAN 77 & Linux, Unix, OS X \\\hline
\href{http://www.mingw.org}{MinGW} & & C++11, FORTRAN 77 & Windows \\\hline
\href{http://www.cygwin.com}{Cygwin} (GCC) & & C++11, FORTRAN 77 & Windows \\\hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}
On Windows, Visual Studio does not compile prepackaged with a FORTRAN 77 compiler.  Though, one can be purchased from a commercial vendor.  As a result, we recommend using either MinGW or Cygwin on Windows.  The primary difference between the two is that Cygwin will create a dependency to the Cygwin runtime libraries during compilation, but MinGW will not.  This becomes important when distributing applications built with Optizelle.  On OS X, the default compilers tend to use old versions of LLVM-GCC (4.2), which is not sufficient to compile Optizelle.  Newer versions of GCC can be found through \href{https://www.macports.org}{MacPorts} or \href{http://hpc.sourceforge.net}{HPC Mac OS X}.

       Next, Optizelle requires a Make utility compatible with CMake.  A small slection of such utilities is 
\phantomsection\label{tbl:make}
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
{\bf Make} & {\bf Platform}\\\hline
\href{https://www.gnu.org/software/make}{GNU Make} & Linux, Unix, OS X \\\hline
\href{http://www.mingw.org}{MSYS} & Windows\\\hline
\href{http://www.cygwin.com}{Cygwin} (GNU Make) & Windows \\\hline
\href{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio}{NMake} & Windows \\\hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}

        Finally, Optizelle is compatible with high-performance varieties of BLAS and LAPACK as long as they contain support for the newer LAPACK functions.  A small subset of these libraries are
\phantomsection\label{tbl:blaslapack}
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
{\bf BLAS/LAPACK Library} & \bf{Version}\\\hline
\href{http://www.netlib.org/lapack}{FORTRAN 77 Source} & $\geq$ 3.4.2\\\hline
\href{http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net}{ATLAS} & \\\hline
\href{http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl}{Intel MKL} & \\\hline
\href{http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/cpu-development/amd-core-math-library-acml}{AMD ACML} & \\\hline
\href{https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/gotoblas2}{Goto BLAS} & \\\hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}

\section{Building}

        Optizelle uses CMake as its build system.  On Linux, Unix, OS X, or Cygwin, execute the following commands from the base Optizelle directory:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textct{mkdir build}
    \item \textct{cd build}
    \item \textct{ccmake ..}
    \item Configure the build.
    \item \textct{make}
\end{enumerate}
On Windows, if not using Cygwin, execute the following commands:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using Windows Explorer, create a directory called \textct{build} in the base Optizelle directory.
    \item Run \textct{cmake-gui.exe}
    \item Set the source directory to the base Optizelle directory.
    \item Set the build directory to the \textct{build} folder created above.
    \item Configure the build.
    \item Build the code (\textct{make} with MSYS.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Configuring}

        Optizelle provides several different options within CMake in order to customize the build.  We describe these flags in the table below.

\section{Installing}

    After building Optizelle, installation is as simple as executing
\begin{center}
        \texttt{make install}
\end{center}
from the CMake build directory using GNU Make, MSYS, or Cygwin.  If using a different Make utility, call it on the \textct{install} target.  For a complete list of installed files, see 
\begin{center}
    \textct{install_manifest.txt}
\end{center}
located in the CMake build directory.

    The CMake variable \textctref{CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} determines Optizelle's base installation directory.  From there, we install Optizelle into the following directory tree.  For brevity, we do not list all of the installed files in this diagram, but a selection of the most important files.
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}
    \dirtree{%
        .1 \$\{\textctref{CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}\}.
        .2 lib.
        .3 liboptizelle.a.
        .3 liboptizelle.so.
        .2 include.
        .3 optizelle.
        .4 optizelle.h.
        .4 json.h.
        .4 vspaces.h.
        .2 share.
        .3 optizelle.
        .4 doc.
        .5 Optizelle-@CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR@.@CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR@.@CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH@.pdf.
        .4 python.
        .5 Optizelle.
        .4 matlab.
        .5 setupOptizelle.m.
        .4 examples.
    }
\end{minipage}\end{center}
If the \textctref{ENABLE_BUILD_JSONCPP} variable is set to \textct{ON}, then we also install JsonCpp to the following location.
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}
    \dirtree{%
        .1 \$\{\textctref{CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}\}.
        .2 lib.
        .3 libjson.a.
        .3 libjson.so.
        .2 include.
        .3 json.
        .4 json.h.
    }
\end{minipage}\end{center}
Finally, if the \textctref{ENABLE_BUILD_BLAS_AND_LAPACK} variable is set to \textct{ON}, then we install BLAS and LAPACK to the following location.
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}
    \dirtree{%
        .1 \$\{\textctref{CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}\}.
        .2 lib.
        .3 libblas.so.
        .3 liblapack.so.
    }
\end{minipage}\end{center}

\section{Uninstalling}

        In order to uninstall Optizelle under Linux, Unix, OS X, MSYS, or Cygwin, execute the following command
\begin{center}
    \textct{xargs rm < install_manifest.txt}
\end{center}
from the CMake build directory. 

\section{Distributing}

        Optizelle uses CPack, part of the CMake package, in order to distribute the Optizelle source and compiled binaries.  In order to make a new distributable source package on Linux, Unix, OS X, MSYS, or Cygwin run 
\begin{center}
    \textct{make package_source}
\end{center}
from the CMake build directory.  If using an altnernative Make utility, run it on the target \textct{package_source} from the same directory.  Note, all files in the Optizelle directory tree except for the current build directory are included in the source package with this method.  Specifically, if the directory structure contains multiple build directories, CMake incorporates these in the source package as well, which is probably undesirable. 

        In order to package compiled binaries to other systems, run
\begin{center}
    \textct{cpack}
\end{center}
in the build directory.  This encapsulates Optizelle as well as JsonCpp, BLAS, and LAPACK if they were also built during compilation.

\chapter{Basic API}\label{ch:Basic}

        We organize Optizelle's algorithms into four different categories: 
\begin{center}
    \usebox{\boxOptimizationTypes}
\end{center}
\noindent Since these formulations necessitate different algorithms, we segregate the overall structure of Optizelle and the algorithms themselves into these categories.  
        In order to optimize these formulations, we follow the general procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Import Optizelle.
    \item Import or define the appropriate vector spaces.
    \item Define the objective function.
    \item (Optional) Define the constraints.
    \item Create the optimization state. 
    \item Set the optimization parameters.
    \item Bundle all the functions needed for optimization together. 
    \item Solve the optimization problem. 
    \item Extract the solution.
\end{enumerate}
We discuss how to implement each of the above steps below. 

\section{Import Optizelle}

        Each interface uses its own method to import Optizelle:
\begin{filecontents*}{import.cpp}
#include "optizelle/optizelle.h"
#include "optizelle/vspaces.h"
#include "optizelle/json.h"
\end{filecontents*}

\begin{filecontents*}{import.py}
import Optizelle 

import Optizelle.Unconstrained.State
import Optizelle.Unconstrained.Functions
import Optizelle.Unconstrained.Algorithms
import Optizelle.Unconstrained.Restart
import Optizelle.json.Unconstrained

import Optizelle.EqualityConstrained.State
import Optizelle.EqualityConstrained.Functions
import Optizelle.EqualityConstrained.Algorithms
import Optizelle.EqualityConstrained.Restart
import Optizelle.json.EqualityConstrained

import Optizelle.InequalityConstrained.State
import Optizelle.InequalityConstrained.Functions
import Optizelle.InequalityConstrained.Algorithms
import Optizelle.InequalityConstrained.Restart
import Optizelle.json.InequalityConstrained

import Optizelle.Constrained.State
import Optizelle.Constrained.Functions
import Optizelle.Constrained.Algorithms
import Optizelle.Constrained.Restart
import Optizelle.json.Constrained
\end{filecontents*}

\begin{filecontents*}{import.m}
global Optizelle;
setupOptizelle();
\end{filecontents*}

\begin{boldlist}
    \exampleitem
        {C++}
        {\lstinputlisting[style=C++]{import.cpp}}
    \exampleitem
        {Python}
        {\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{import.py}}
    \exampleitem

        {\lstinputlisting[style=Matlab]{import.m}}
\end{boldlist}

\noindent In C++, we always require \textct{optizelle/optizelle.h}, but only require \textct{optizelle/json.h} when working with JSON and \textct{optizelle/vspaces.h} when using our default vector spaces such as \textct{Optizelle::Rm} and \textct{Optizelle::SQL}.  In Python, the module required by the structures below can be determined by the element in \textbf{Structure}.  For example, the structure \textct{Optizelle.Unconstrained.State.t} requires the module \textct{Optizelle.Unconstrained.State}.  Finally, in MATLAB/Octave, we encapsulate all of the required functions in the global variable \textct{Optizelle}.

\section{Import Or Define the Appropriate Vector Spaces}
        In the optimization problems
\begin{center}
    \usebox{\boxOptimizationTypes}
\end{center}
\noindent we require that
\begin{align*}
    f :& X\rightarrow\re\\
    g :& X\rightarrow Y\\
    h :& X\rightarrow Z.
\end{align*}
Here, the spaces $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ denote vector spaces.  For most problems, these vector spaces just denote $\re^m$, but we also allow these vector spaces to be spaces of functions such as $L^2(\Omega)$ or matrices such as $\re^{m\times n}$ as long as they contain the necessary operations.

        A vector space consists of two separate pieces: the actual vector and the operations required to compute on this vector.  In Optizelle, we maintain this separation.  For $\re^m$, we provide reasonable implementations for 

In this case, we use the following built-in vector space:
\begin{boldlist}
    \apiitem
        {C++}
        {\textct{Optizelle::Rm}}
        {Use as is}
        {\lstinputlisting[style=C++,linerange={Optizelle0-Optizelle1,Rm0-Rm1,Optizelle2-Optizelle3}]{@OPTIZELLECPPPATH@/vspaces.h}}

    \apiitem
        {Python}
        {\textct{Optizelle.Rm}}
        {Use as is}
        {\lstinputlisting[style=Python,linerange=Rm0-Rm1]{@OPTIZELLEPYTHONPATH@/__init__.py}}

    \apiitem
        {MATLAB/Octave}
        {\textct{Optizelle.Rm}}
        {Use as is}
        {\lstinputlisting[style=Matlab,linerange=Rm0-Rm1]{@OPTIZELLEMATLABPATH@/setupOptizelle.m}}
\end{boldlist}
\noindent Note, each of the above structures denotes an algebra on the vector-spaces.  For actual vectors, we simply use \textct{std::vector} in C++, NumPy arrays in Python, and column vectors in MATLAB/Octave.  In other words, from a strictly user point of view, we can safely use the above vector spaces, ignoring their implementation details, as long as we use either a \textct{std::vector}, NumPy array, or column vector for our variables.

        Outside of Rm, we also allow these vector spaces of functions such as $L^2(\Omega)$ or martrices such as $\re^{m\times n}$ as long as these spaces provide sufficient vector-space operations.  Specifically, for $W\in\{X,Y,Z\}$, we require that $W$ provide the functions:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|lll|}\hline
    \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Definition} & \textbf{Languages}\\\hline
    \textct{init(x)} & $\textit{init}\leftarrow \xi(W)$ & C++, Python, MATLAB/Octave\\\hline

    \textct{copy(x,y)} & $y\leftarrow x$ & C++, Python\\
    \textct{copy(x)} & $\textit{copy}\leftarrow x$ & MATLAB/Octave\\\hline

    \textct{scal(alpha,x)} & $x\leftarrow \alpha x$ & C++, Python\\
    & $\textit{scal}\leftarrow \alpha x$ & MATLAB/Octave\\\hline

    \textct{axpy(alpha,x,y)} & $y\leftarrow \alpha x+y$ & C++, Python\\
    & $\textit{axpy}\leftarrow \alpha x+y$ & MATLAB/Octave\\\hline

    \textct{innr(x,y)} & $\textit{innr}\leftarrow \langle x,y\rangle$ & C++, Python, MATLAB/Octave\\\hline
    
    \textct{zero(x)} & $x\leftarrow 0$ & C++, Python\\
    & $\textit{zero}\leftarrow 0$ & MATLAB/Octave\\\hline
    
    \textct{rand(x)} & $x\leftarrow \psi(W)$ & C++, Python\\
    & $\textit{rand}\leftarrow \psi(W)$ & MATLAB/Octave\\\hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}
Here, the notation $x\leftarrow \alpha x$ means we assign the element $x$ the value $\alpha x$ whereas the notation $\textit{scal}\leftarrow \alpha x$ means we return the result $\alpha x$.  Next, $\xi,\psi:\mathcal{P}(W)\rightarrow W$ denote choice functions where $\xi$ and $\psi$ are typically deterministic and stochastic, respectfully.  In other words, $\xi$ and $\psi$ choose either fixed or random elements of $W$.  More specifically, we use \textct{init} to allocate memory and \textct{rand} to conduct diagnostic tests.

\section{Define the Objective Function}

        In the optimization problems
\begin{center}
    \usebox{\boxOptimizationTypes}
\end{center}
\noindent the function $f:X\rightarrow\re$ denotes the \textit{objective function}.  Note, we restrict ourselves to scalar-valued functions and do not consider multi-objective optimization problems.  In order to optimize with this function, we require information about its evaluation and derivatives.  Specifically, we require its evaluation, $f(x)$, and gradient $\nabla f(x)$.  In order to second-order algorithms, we also require the Hessian-vector product, $\nabla^2 f(x)\delta x$.  In code, we specify this function as
\begin{boldlist}
    \apiitem
        {C++}
        {\textct{Optizelle::ScalarValuedFunction}}
        {Inheritance}
        {\lstinputlisting[style=C++,linerange={Optizelle0-Optizelle1,ScalarValuedFunction0-ScalarValuedFunction1,Optizelle2-Optizelle3}]{@OPTIZELLECPPPATH@/optizelle.h}}

    \apiitem
        {Python}
        {\textct{Optizelle.ScalarValuedFunction}}
        {Inheritance}
        {\lstinputlisting[style=Python,linerange=ScalarValuedFunction0-ScalarValuedFunction1]{@OPTIZELLEPYTHONPATH@/__init__.py}}

    \apiitem
        {MATLAB/Octave}
        {\textct{Optizelle.ScalarValuedFunction}}
        {Members present}
        {\lstinputlisting[style=Matlab,linerange=ScalarValuedFunction0-ScalarValuedFunction1]{@OPTIZELLEMATLABPATH@/setupOptizelle.m}}
\end{boldlist}
\noindent Note, we require that the Hessian-vector product always be present.  If one is not available, we simply return zero.
        
        As an example, the Rosenbrock function is the function $f:\re^2\rightarrow \re$ where 
$$
        f(x)=(1-x_1)^2+100(x_2-x_1^2)^2.
$$
This function has a gradient of
$$
        \nabla f(x)=\begin{bmatrix}
            -400x_1(x_2-x_1^2)-2(1-x_1)\\
            200(x_2-x_1^2)
        \end{bmatrix}
$$
and Hessian-vector product of 
$$
        \nabla^2 f(x)\delta x=
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1200x_1^2-400x_2+2 & -400x_1\\
            -400x_1 & 200
        \end{bmatrix}\delta x.
$$
Using Optizelle's internal vector spaces, we implement these functions as

\section{Define the Constraints}
        In the optimization problems
\begin{center}
    \usebox{\boxOptimizationTypes}
\end{center}
\noindent the functions $g:X\rightarrow Y$ and $h:X\rightarrow Z$ denote the \textit{equality} and \textit{inequality constraints}, respectfully.  Here, we allow the equality constraints to be nonlinear, but require that the inequality constraints be affine.  Recall, an affine function is one where $h(\alpha x+(1-\alpha)x)=\alpha h(x)+(1-\alpha)h(y)$ for $\alpha\in\re$ or equivalently where $h^{\prime\prime}(x)=0$.  Note, we require affine inequality constraints in order to simplify the line search that maintains the nonnegativity of the inequality constraints.  In case we have a nonlinear inequality constraint, we must reformulate the problem in order to make it affine.  The easiest method for doing so is through the reformulations 
$$\left.\begin{array}{rcl}
        \min\limits_{x\in X} && f(x)\\
        \st && h(x)\succeq 0
\end{array}\right\}
\leadsto
\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
        \min\limits_{x\in X,z\in Z} && f(x)\\
        \st && h(x)-z=0\\
            && z\succeq 0
\end{array}\right.$$
and
$$\left.\begin{array}{rcl}
        \min\limits_{x\in X} && f(x)\\
        \st && g(x)=0\\
            && h(x)\succeq 0
\end{array}\right\}
\leadsto
\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
        \min\limits_{x\in X,z\in Z} && f(x)\\
        \st && \begin{bmatrix}g(x)\\h(x)-z\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}\\
            && z\succeq 0.
\end{array}\right.$$
Next, we see that the functions $g$ and $h$ denote vector-valued functions.  Generally, the spaces $Y$ and $Z$ denote a space like $\re^m$, but they can represent any vector space as long as we provide Optizelle with the appropriate vector-space functions.  Notably, we use this feature to allow the inequality constraint $h(x)\succeq 0$ represent symmetric cone problems.  Expanding on this point, when $Z=\re^m$ and using the \textct{Rm} vector space in Optizelle, the inequality $h(x)\succeq 0$ denotes pointwise inequality.  However, if we use the \textct{SQL} vector space, we can also represent semidefinite and second-order cone inequalities.  A semidefinite inequality is one where $Z=\re^{m\times m}$ and we restrict $h(x)$ to be positive semidefinite.  A second-order cone inequality is one where $Z=\re^{m+1}$ and $h(x)=\begin{bmatrix} h_0(x) & \bar{h}(x)\end{bmatrix}^T$ and we restrict $h_0(x)\geq \|\bar{h}(x)\|_2$.

Note, we restrict ourselves to scalar-valued functions and do not consider multi-objective optimization problems.  In order to optimize with this function, we require information about its evaluation and derivatives.  Specifically, we require its evaluation, $f(x)$, and gradient $\nabla f(x)$.  In order to second-order algorithms, we also require the Hessian-vector product, $\nabla^2 f(x)\delta x$.  In code, we specify this function as

        Optizelle defines the constraints as a vector-valued function that inherits from \texttt{Optizelle::VectorValuedFunction}, which Optizelle defines as
\input{constraintSpecification.tex}
This abstract class corresponds to the evaluation of the constraint, $g(x)$, Fr\'{e}chet derivative (Jacobian)-vector product, $g^\prime(x)\delta x$, adjoint of the F\'{e}chet derivative (Jacobian)-vector product, $g^\prime(x)^*\delta y$, and the second derivative adjoint-vector product, $(g^{\prime\prime}(x)\delta x)^*\delta y$.  Here, $^*$ denotes the Hilbert-adjoint, which is most often the transpose of the operator.  Alternatively, if we work in $\re^m$ with the $\ell^2$ inner product, we can define these operators as
\begin{align*}
        g(x)&=\begin{bmatrix}
            g_1(x)\\
            \dots\\
            g_m(x)
        \end{bmatrix}
        & g^\prime(x)\delta x&=\begin{bmatrix}
                \nabla g_1(x)^T \delta x\\
                \dots\\
                \nabla g_m(x)^T \delta x
        \end{bmatrix}\\
        g^\prime(x)^*\delta y&=
        \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \nabla g_i(x) [\delta y]_i 
        & (g^{\prime\prime}(x)\delta x)^*\delta y&=
        \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \nabla^2 g_i(x)\delta x [\delta y]_i 
\end{align*}
As with the objective function, the algorithms in Optizelle do not require second order information, but benefit from it when available.  As such, the evaluation of $(g^{\prime\prime}(x)\delta x)^*\delta y$ is not strictly required.  If not available, set the result of the second derivative adjoint-vector product to zero.

        For example, we define a simple vector-valued function as
$$
    f(x)=\begin{bmatrix}
        (x_1-2)^2 + (x_2-2)^2 - 1\\
        x_1 + 2x_2 - 1.
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
Then, we have that
\begin{align*}
    f^\prime(x)\delta x=&\begin{bmatrix}
        2(x_1-2) & 2(x_2-2)\\
        1 & 2
    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\delta x_1\\\delta x_2\end{bmatrix}\\
    f^\prime(x)^*\delta y=&
        \begin{bmatrix}
            2(x_1-2)\\
            2(x_2-2)
        \end{bmatrix}  \delta y_1
        +
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1\\
            2
        \end{bmatrix} \delta y_2\\
    (f^{\prime\prime}(x)\delta x)^*\delta y=&
        \begin{bmatrix}
            2 & 0\\
            0 & 2
        \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\delta x_1\\\delta x_2\end{bmatrix}
            \delta y_1
        +\begin{bmatrix}
            0 & 0\\
            0 & 0
        \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\delta x_1\\\delta x_2\end{bmatrix}
            \delta y_2.
\end{align*}
In code, we implement these operators as
\input{constraintExample.tex}

\section{Define an Initial Guess} 

        The class \texttt{Optizelle::Rm} used in each of our examples defines an algebra for vectors in $\re^m$.  Underneath, the storage used for these vectors is simply a \texttt{std::vector}.  As such, we define our initial guess using this class.

        As an example, our initial guess for the Rosenbrock function was $\begin{bmatrix}-1.2 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T$.  We implement this in code as
\input{initialGuessExample.tex}

\section{Allocate Memory for Elements in the Codomain of the Constraints}

        As with our initial guess, we also use the class \texttt{Optizelle::Rm} to represent elements in the codomain of our constraints.  These elements correspond to the Lagrange multipliers or dual variables for the constrained algorithms, but, beyond label, we require no additional information about duality theory.  In addition, these elements are purely used for allocating memory.  This means that the value of these vectors when passed to Optizelle is ignored.

        For example, if we have a single equality constraint, we allocate memory for the codomain as
\input{allocateCodomainExample.tex}

\section{Create an Optimization State}\label{sec:State}

        In Optizelle, the optimization state contains an entire description of the current state of the optimization algorithm.  This is unique to the particular optimization formulation, but all algorithms in a particular formulations share the same state.  Most algorithms do not require information about all of these pieces, but they are present to make it easier to switch from one algorithm to another.  For example, trust-region and line-search algorithms share several components, but the trust-region radius is unique to trust-region algorithms and the line-search step length is unique to line-search algorithms.  Nevertheless, we may want to switch from one algorithm to another, so they share the same components.

        In order to define an optimization state, we instantiate the state class within the particular class of formulation we require.  The syntax is
\input{stateSpecification.tex}
where these states correspond to the unconstrained, inequality constrained, equality constrained, and constrained formulations, respectively.  The variables \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, and \texttt{z} correspond to elements in the domain of the objective, codomain of the equality constraints, and codomain of the inequality constraints, respectively.  Finally, the first template parameter denotes the floating point precision used by the optimization.  The remaining template parameters denote the vector space used by each of the elements, \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, and \texttt{z}. 

\section{Set the Optimization Parameters}

        For each optimization problem, the parameters required for an efficient optimization solve can vary wildly.  Nevertheless, the parameters that guide this process reside within the state object.  There are two mechanisms for modifying these entries.  First, the state object created in Section \ref{sec:State} is simply a class with a variety of elements.  These can be modified directly.  Alternatively, if the Optizelle library is installed, we can use the JSON reader.  The syntax for reading a parameter file in JSON format from file is
\input{jsonReaderSpecification.tex}
where these four different commands correspond to unconstrained, inequality constrained, equality constrained, and constrained formulations, respectively.  As before, the template parameters denote first the precision required and then the vector spaces used by the optimization.

        Note, although the names of the parameters used by each are identical, the format is slightly different depending on whether we directly modify the state or use the JSON reader.  For example, the following JSON file modifies the stopping criteria for the gradient
\input{jsonReaderExample1.tex}
This has the same affect as the code
\input{jsonReaderExample2.tex}

        As far as the actual parameters and their affect, we discuss this in Chapter \ref{ch:Input}.

\section{Accumulate the Functions}

        In order to pass the functions used in the optimization to Optizelle, we accumulate each of them into a bundle of functions.  These bundles are simple structures that contain a number of \texttt{std::auto\_ptr} objects that point to the appropriate function.  The syntax for creating these objects is
\input{functionBundleSpecification.tex}
where \texttt{f} refers to a \texttt{ScalarValuedFunction} that denotes the objective, \texttt{g} refers to a \texttt{VectorValuedFunction} that denotes the equality constraint, and \texttt{h} refers to an affine \texttt{VectorValuedFunction} that denotes the inequality constraint.  Note, each of these structures only contains elements appropriate for their particular formulation.  For example, the bundle of functions that corresponds to unconstrained optimization only contains the element for \texttt{f} and not for \texttt{g} and \texttt{h}.

\section{Call the Optimization Solver}

       Once the state, parameters, and functions are set, calling the optimization solver is straightforward.  Simply, we call one of the four commands
\input{solverSpecification.tex}
These commands accept three input arguments: the messaging object, the bundle of functions, and the state.  The messaging object \texttt{Optizelle::Messaging()} sends the output to \texttt{stdout}.  This can be modified and we discuss how in Chapter \ref{ch:Advanced}.  Once the solver routine has been called, the optimization algorithms iterate until the stopping criteria is satisfied.  Generally, this creates a collection diagnostic information and we discuss the format of these output in Chapter \ref{ch:Output}.

\section{Extract the Solution}

        After the optimization routine concludes, the solution resides inside of the optimization state in a variable called \texttt{x}.  This is a \texttt{std::list} that contains a single element, the solution.  Optizelle stores each of its vector arguments inside of list in order to more efficiently manage memory.  This makes more advanced optimization techniques such as saving the state of the optimization and restarting a computation later easier.  The command required to extract the solution is the same for each formulation
\input{solutionExtractionSpecification.tex}

\chapter{Input Specifications}\label{ch:Input}

        The parameters that guide the optimization solver have a dramatic effect on the performance of the internal algorithms.  As such, we catalog these parameters and their affect below. 

\begin{longtable}{llp{0.4\textwidth}}
\multicolumn{3}{p{\textwidth}}{\bf Parameters for: Unconstrained, Inequality Constrained, Equality Constrained, Constrained}\\
Name & Default & Description\\
\texttt{eps\_grad} & $10^{-8}$ 
    & Relative tolerance for the gradient stopping criteria.  In unconstrained problems, Optizelle terminates when $\| \nabla f(x_k) \| \leq \epsilon \| \nabla f(x_0) \|$ where $x_k$ denotes the solution at the $k$-th iteration.  For inequality constrained problems, the gradient stopping criteria is $\| \ineqGradLag{x_k}{z_k} \| \leq \epsilon \| \ineqGradLag{x_0}{z_0}) \|$.  For equality constrained problems, this becomes $\| \eqGradLag{x_k}{y_k} \| \leq \epsilon \| \eqGradLag{x_0}{y_0} \|$.  Finally, for constrained problems, the stopping criteria is $\| \conGradLag{x_k}{y_k}{z_k} \| \leq \epsilon \| \conGradLag{x_0}{y_0}{z_0} \|$.\\
\\
\texttt{eps\_dx} & $10^{-8}$
    & Relative tolerance for the step length stopping criteria.  In unconstrained problems, Optizelle terminates when $\|\delta x\| \leq \epsilon \|\nabla f(x_0)\|$ where $\delta x$ denotes the step in the optimization variables at the current iteration and $x_0$ denotes the initial guess provided to the optimization.  For inequality constrained problems, Optizelle terminates when $\|\delta x\| \leq \epsilon \| \ineqGradLag{x_0}{z_0} \|$.  For equality constrained problems, this becomes $\|\delta x\| \leq \epsilon \| \eqGradLag{x_0}{y_0} \|$.  For constrained problems, this becomes $\|\delta x\| \leq \epsilon \| \conGradLag{x_0}{y_0}{z_0} \|$.\\
\\
\texttt{stored\_history} & 0
    & Number of vectors stored for use with quasi-Newton methods such as SR1 and BFGS\\
\\
\texttt{history\_reset} & 5
    & Number of failed trust-region iterations or line-search batches before the quasi-Newton information is discarded and Optizelle takes a steepest descent direction.\\
\\
\texttt{iter\_max} & 10
    & Maximum number of optimization iterations.\\
\\
\texttt{krylov\_iter\_max} & 10 
    & Maximum number of iterations taken by either truncated-CG or truncated-MINRES when solving the optimality system.\\
\\
\texttt{krylov\_orthog\_max} & 0 
    & Numbers of vectors stored and used in the orthogonalization of truncated-CG or truncated-MINRES.  In exact arithmetic, the number can be provably 0. In practice, if memory is available, it may be worthwhile to over orthogonalize. \\
\\
\texttt{eps\_krylov} & $10^{-2}$
    & Relative stopping criteria for truncated-CG or truncated-MINRES.  In truncated-CG, the stopping criteria when solving the system $Ax=b$ with preconditioner $B$ is $\|B(Ax_k-b)\|\leq \epsilon\|B(Ax_0-b)\|$.  In truncated-MINRES, the stopping criteria is $\|Ax_k-b\|_B \leq \epsilon\|Ax_0-b\|_B$.\\
\\
\texttt{krylov\_solver} & \texttt{ConjugateDirection}
    & Linear system solver used when solving the optimality conditions.  This can either be \texttt{ConjugateDirection} or \texttt{MINRES}.\\
\\
\texttt{algorithm\_class} & \texttt{TrustRegion}
    & Class of algorithm used in optimization.  This can either be \texttt{TrustRegion}, \texttt{LineSearch}, or \texttt{UserDefined}.\\
\\
\texttt{PH\_type} & \texttt{Identity}
    & Preconditioner used when solving the optimality conditions.  This can be either \texttt{Identity}, \texttt{InvBFGS}, or \texttt{InvSR1}, which correspond to the identity operator, a BFGS-based preconditioner, or a SR1 based preconditioner, respectively.\\
\texttt{H\_type} & \texttt{UserDefined}
    & Hessian approximation for the objective function.  This can be either \texttt{UserDefined}, \texttt{Identity}, \texttt{ScaledIdentity}, \texttt{BFGS}, or \texttt{SR1}.  If \texttt{UserDefined} is chosen, Optizelle uses the \texttt{hessvec} calculation inside of the objective function to calculate the Hessian-vector product.  Otherwise, the \texttt{Identity}, \texttt{BFGS}, and \texttt{SR1} approximations corresponds to the identity operator, BFGS, and SR1 operators, respectively.  Finally, the \texttt{ScaledIdentity} option directs Optizelle to use a scaled version of the identity matrix defined as $\|\nabla f(x)\|/(2\Delta) I$ where $\Delta$ denotes the trust-region radius.  This forces the algorithm to take a steepest-descent step the size of the trust-region at every iteration.  This implements a steepest-descent algorithm with a trust-region method. \\
\\
\texttt{msg\_level} & 1
    & Controls the amount of diagnostic output produced by Optizelle.  Here, 0 denotes no output and 1 denotes print information about each optimization iteration.\\
\\
\texttt{delta} & 1.0
    & Initial size of the trust-region radius\\
\\
\texttt{eta1} & 0.1
    & When the actual versus predicted reduction for a trust-region method is below this threshold, the step is rejected.  Otherwise, it is accepted.\\
\\
\texttt{eta2} & 0.9
    & When the actual versus predicted reduction for a trust-region method is above this threshold, the trust-region radius is increased when the trust-region radius inhibits the progress of the algorithm.\\
\\
\texttt{alpha0} & 1.0
    & Initial line-search step length.\\
\\
\texttt{linesearch\_iter\_max} & 5
    & Maximum number of line-search iterations conducted before checking for a reduction in the objective value.\\
\\
\texttt{dir} & \texttt{SteepestDescent}
    & Line-search direction taken by a line-search algorithm.  This can be either \texttt{SteepestDescent}, \texttt{FletcherReeves}, \texttt{PolakRibiere}, \texttt{HestenesStiefel}, \texttt{BFGS}, or \texttt{NewtonCG}.  The \texttt{FletcherReeves}, \texttt{PolakRibiere}, and \texttt{HestenesStiefel} directions corresponds to different flavors of Nonlinear-CG.  The \texttt{BFGS} direction implements a standard BFGS algorithm.  Finally, \texttt{NewtonCG} defines a Newton-CG algorithm that uses the current Hessian approximation defined by \texttt{H\_type} in order to calculate the direction.\\
\\
\texttt{kind} & \texttt{GoldenSection}
    & Kind of line-search algorithm used in a line-search algorithm.  This can be either \texttt{GoldenSection}, \texttt{BackTracking}, \texttt{TwoPointA}, or \texttt{TwoPointB}.  The algorithms \texttt{GoldenSection} and \texttt{BackTracking} correspond to a golden section search and a back tracking line-search, respectively.  \texttt{TwoPointA} and \texttt{TwoPointB} correspond to a line-search based on a two-point approximation of the Hessian.  This is used by the Barzilai-Borwein algorithm for unconstrained optimization.  If either \texttt{TwoPointA} or \texttt{TwoPointB} are chosen, it is important to set \texttt{dir} to \texttt{SteepestDescent}.\\
\\
\multicolumn{3}{p{\textwidth}}{\bf Parameters for: Inequality Constrained, Constrained}\\
Name & Default & Description\\
\texttt{eps\_mu} & $10^{-8}$
    & Absolute tolerance for the interior point stopping criteria.  Optizelle defines the estimate of the infeasibility with respect to the complementary slackness stopping condition as $\langle z,h(x) \rangle/\langle e,e\rangle$ where $z$ denotes the inequality multiplier and $e$ denotes the identity element for the inequality algebra.  For linear bound constraints, this is the vector of all ones, so $\langle e,e\rangle=m$ where $m$ denotes the number of variables.  Hence, the stopping criteria for the inequality constraints is $\mu < \epsilon$.  Since we always choose a starting inequality multiplier so that $\langle z,h(x) \rangle/\langle e,e\rangle=1$, this tolerance is effectively a relative tolerance as well.\\
\\
\texttt{sigma} & $0.5$
    & Rate at which Optizelle attempts to decrease the interior point parameter.  Specifically, if the current estimate of the interior point parameter is $\mu$, then we attempt to reduce $\mu$ to $\sigma \mu$.\\
\\
\texttt{gamma} & $0.95$
    & How close Optizelle allows a step in the optimization algorithm to approach the boundary.  A step of $1.0$ would allow a step to touch the boundary of the inequality constraint in a single step, which is disallowed by the interior point algorithm.\\
\\
\texttt{ipm} & \texttt{PrimalDual}
    & Kind of interior-point method used by Optizelle.  Optizelle allows either \texttt{PrimalDual}, \texttt{PrimalDualLinked}, or \texttt{LogBarrier}.  This corresponds to either a primal-dual interior point method, a primal-dual interior point method where the primal and dual step lengths are linked together, or a log-barrier algorithm.\\
\\
\texttt{cstrat} & \texttt{Constant}
    & Centrality strategy used by the interior-point method.  Optizelle allows either \texttt{Constant}, \texttt{StairStep}, or \texttt{PredictorCorrector} strategies.  This corresponds to a constant reduction in the interior point parameter by $\sigma$, reducing $\sigma$ only when the relative reduction in the interior point parameter $\mu$ is less than the relative reduction in the gradient stopping condition, or a predictor-corrector strategy where on even iterations $\sigma=0$ and on odd iterations $\sigma=1$.\\
\\
\multicolumn{3}{p{\textwidth}}{\bf Parameters for: Equality Constrained, Constrained}\\
Name & Default & Description\\
\texttt{zeta} & 0.8 & Fraction of the trust-region used for the quasi-normal step.\\
\\
\texttt{eta0} & 0.5 & Trust-region parameter that bounds the error in the predicted-reduction.\\
\\
\texttt{rho} & 1.0 & Initial penalty parameter used in the augmented Lagrangian.  For globalization purposes, the equality constrained algorithm uses an augmented Lagrangian of the form $f(x)+\langle y,g(x)\rangle+\rho\|g(x)\|^2$.  For the constrained algorithms, Optizelle uses an augmented Lagrangian of the form $f(x)+\langle y,g(x)\rangle+\rho\|g(x)\|^2-\mu \textnormal{barr}(h(x))$ where $\textnormal{barr}(x)$ denotes the barrier functioned defined in the inequality algebra.\\
\\
\texttt{rho\_bar} & $10^{-8}$ & Fixed increase in the penalty parameter in the augmented Lagrangian merit function.\\
\\
\texttt{eps\_constr} & $10^{-8}$ & Relative stopping tolerance for feasibility with respect to the equality constraint.  Optizelle requires that $\|g(x_k)\|<\epsilon\|g(x_0)||$ in order to terminate where $x_k$ denotes the solution at the $k$-th iteration.\\
\\
\texttt{xi\_all} & $10^{-4}$ & Relative stopping tolerance for all of the augmented system solves, \texttt{xi\_qn}, \texttt{xi\_pg}, \texttt{xi\_proj}, \texttt{xi\_proj}, \texttt{xi\_tang}, and \texttt{xi\_lmh}, described below.\\
\\
\texttt{xi\_qn} & \texttt{xi\_all} & Relative stopping tolerance for the augmented system solve associated with the quasi-Newton step.\\
\\
\texttt{xi\_pg} & \texttt{xi\_all} & Relative stopping tolerance for the augmented system solve associated with the projection of the gradient prior to solving the tangential subproblem.\\
\\
\texttt{xi\_proj} & \texttt{xi\_all} & Relative stopping tolerance for the augmented system solve associated with the null-space projection of the iterate in the tangential subproblem.\\ 
\\
\texttt{xi\_tang} & \texttt{xi\_all} & Relative stopping tolerance for the augmented system solve associated with the tangential step computation after solving the tangential subproblem. \\
\\
\texttt{xi\_lmh} & \texttt{xi\_all} & Relative stopping tolerance for the augmented system solve associated with the equality multiplier computation.\\
\\
\texttt{xi\_lmg} & $10^4$ & Absolute tolerance on the residual of the equality multiplier solve. \\
\\
\texttt{xi\_4} & 2.0 & Tolerance for how much error is acceptable after computing the tangential step given the result from the tangential subproblem.\\
\\
\texttt{augsys\_iter\_max} & 100 & Maximum number of GMRES iterations allowed when solving an augmented system.\\
\\
\texttt{augsys\_rst\_freq} & 0 & Restarts GMRES every specified number of iterations in order to save memory.  When 0, Optizelle uses no restarting.\\
\\
\texttt{PSchur\_left\_type} & \texttt{Identity} & Type of left Schur preconditioner used by Optizelle during an augmented system solve.  This can be either \texttt{Identity} or \texttt{UserDefined}.  An augmented system solve finds the solution of a linear system where the operator has the form $\begin{bmatrix} I & g^\prime(x)^*\\g^\prime(x) & 0\end{bmatrix}$.  The Schur preconditioner for this problem is an operator of the form $\begin{bmatrix} I & 0\\ 0 & B\end{bmatrix}$ where $B$ is the operator specified by this parameter.  Note, if we specify $B=(g^\prime(x)g^\prime(x)^*)^{-1}$, then the augmented system solves in 3 iterations.\\
\\
\texttt{PSchur\_right\_type} & \texttt{Identity} & Type of right Schur preconditioner used by Optizelle during an augmented system solve.  This can be either \texttt{Identity} or \texttt{UserDefined}.
\end{longtable}

\chapter{Output}\label{ch:Output}

        Optizelle generates a series of diagnostics while running that give information about the behavior and performance of the underlying algorithm.  This information is organized into columns that are exactly 10 characters wide.  Each column always has some sort of information, which makes the output easy to parse using standard Unix utilities such as \texttt{cut} or \texttt{awk}.  As far as the information in the columns themselves, we detail their meaning in the following table.

\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\textwidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{p{\textwidth}}{\bf Output for: Unconstrained, Inequality Constrained, Equality Constrained, Constrained}\\
Name & Description\\
\texttt{Iter} & Current optimization iteration.  If the value of this entry is \texttt{*}, that means that a trust-region algorithm has rejected a step due to an unfavorable actual versus predicted reduction. \\
\\
\texttt{f(x)} & Value of the objective function at the start of the specified iteration.\\
\\
\texttt{merit(x)} & Value of the merit function at the start of the iteration.  For an unconstrained problem, this is simply $f(x)$.  For an inequality constrained problem, Optizelle returns $f(x)-\mu \textnormal{barr}(x)$ where $\textnormal{barr}(x)$ denotes the value of the barrier function from the inequality algebra.  For an equality constrained problem, Optizelle gives $f(x)-\langle y, g(x)\rangle + \rho \|g(x)\|^2$.  For a constrained problem, Optizelle defines this quantity as $f(x)-\langle y, g(x)\rangle + \rho \|g(x)\|^2 - \mu\textnormal{barr}(x)$.\\
\\
\texttt{||grad||} & Norm of the gradient of either the objective function or the Lagrangian.  In each case, this denotes the norm of the optimality conditions.  In the unconstrained case, Optizelle defines this quantity as $\|\nabla f(x)\|$.  In the inequality constrained case, this becomes $\|\ineqGradLag{x}{z}\|$.  In the equality constrained case, this is $\|\eqGradLag{x}{y}\|$.  In the fully constrained case, this quantity denotes $\|\conGradLag{x}{y}{z}\|$.\\\\
\texttt{||dx||} & Norm of the step taken during the last iteration. \\
\\
\texttt{ared} & Actual reduction defined as $\textnormal{merit}(x_k)-\textnormal{merit}(x_{k+1})$ where $x_k$ denotes the iterate at the previous step and $x_{k+1}$ denotes the current iterate.\\
\\
\texttt{pred} & Predicted reduction defined as $\textnormal{merit}(x_k)-\textnormal{model}(\delta x)$ where $x_k$ denotes the iterate at the previous step and $\delta x$ denotes the current step.  Depending on the formulation, Optizelle uses a different model, but these models generally correspond to a quadratic approximation to the merit function.\\
\\

\chapter{Advanced API}\label{ch:Advanced}

        Optizelle contains many additional features such as customizing the output and defining custom vector spaces.  We detail these features below.

\section{Messaging Object}

        Optizelle messaging objects inherit from \texttt{Optizelle::Messaging}, which Optizelle defines as
\input{messagingSpecification.tex}
Hence, messaging objects have two functions, \texttt{print} and \texttt{error}, that both accept a string and print the result.  The only difference between \texttt{print} and \texttt{error} is that \texttt{error} must safely exit the program.  Within a larger program, it is common to modify the messaging object so that Optizelle's output goes directly to a specified file.

\section{Custom Vector Spaces}

        Optizelle allows the use of a custom vector space provided by the user.  This allows Optizelle to more easily work with programs that store their information in a custom format.  Simply, we define a new vector space rather than trying to convert the internal data into a \texttt{std::vector}.  The requirements for a new vector space are a structure of the form
\input{vectorSpaceSpecification.tex}
Note, the functions \texttt{prod}, \texttt{id}, \texttt{linv}, \texttt{barr}, \texttt{srch}, and \texttt{symm} are only required for the codomain of the inequality constraint.  We explain these functions below.

\subsection{typedef}

       Optizelle requires that the custom vector space contains a typedef called Vector.  The underlying storage for the vector can be any valid class as long as the class contains a default constructor that does nothing and a copy constructor that knows how to copy items created by the default constructor.  As far as allocating memory for this structure, this is does with the \texttt{init} command that we describe below.

\subsection{init}

        Since allocating memory for a custom object may be complicated, Optizelle uses an \texttt{init} function that copies the structure of a vector from an already existing object.  Hence, this function can be seen as a deep copy from x to y.

\subsection{copy}
        
        The \texttt{copy} function copies the data from x to y using already initialized vectors.  Hence, it implements a shallow copy.

\subsection{scal}

        The \text{scal} function computes and returns the scalar multiple of a vector.  The scalar argument has the same type as the template argument to the structure.

\subsection{zero}

        The \texttt{zero} function transforms a vector into the zero element for the vector space.  In other words, the additive identity element.  The reason that \texttt{zero} exists separately from \texttt{scal} is that if a vector contains NaN elements, the multiplication of zero by NaN is undefined.

\subsection{axpy}

        Next, the function \texttt{axpy} computes the operator $\alpha x + y$ and then stores the result in $y$.

\subsection{innr}

        The inner product function \texttt{innr}, computes the inner product between two elements and then returns the result.  Recall, the inner product is a function $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle\rightarrow \re$ so that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x \rangle$,
    \item $\langle \alpha x,y\rangle = \alpha \langle x,y\rangle$,
    \item $\langle x+y,z\rangle = \langle x,z\rangle + \langle y,z\rangle$,
    \item $\langle x,x\rangle\geq 0$ with equality only when $x=0$.
\end{enumerate}
Note, Optizelle restricts the formulations to real vector spaces.  Note, for $\ell^2$, the inner product can be defined simply as $\langle x,y\rangle=x^Ty$.

\subsection{prod}

        The function \texttt{prod} defines a pseudo-Jordan product between two elements.  We say pseudo-Jordan in the sense that we do not require a full Euclidean-Jordan algebra.  Instead, we drop the requirement for commutativity.  Hence, for linear bound constraints, we define that
$$
        [x\circ y]_i = x_iy_i.
$$
Hence, the product denotes the pointwise or Hadamard product.  For second-order cone constraints, we define that
$$
        \begin{bmatrix}x_0\\\bar{x}\end{bmatrix} \circ \begin{bmatrix}y_0\\\bar{y}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} x_0y_0 + \bar{x}^T\bar{y}\\x_0 \bar{y} + y_0 \bar{x}\end{bmatrix}.
$$
For semidefinite programming, we have that
$$
        X\circ Y = XY.
$$
Alternatively, we can define that
$$
        X\circ Y = \frac{XY + YX}{2},
$$
but the inverse operation we discuss below will be far more inefficient.

\subsection{id} 

       The function \texttt{id} transforms a vector into the identity element for the inequality algebra.  Hence, it returns an element $e$ so that $x\circ e=x$.   For linear bound constraints, $e$ denotes the vector of all ones.  For second-order cone constraints, $e=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \dots & 0\end{bmatrix}^T$.  For semidefinite constraints, $e=I$.

\subsection{linv}

        The function \texttt{linv} denotes the inverse operation to \texttt{prod}.  Note, $\texttt{prod}$ defines a bilinear operation so that there exists a linear operator $L(x)$ such that $x\circ y=L(x)y$.  The function \texttt{linv} computes the action of the {\it inverse} of $L(x)$ on a vector.  For linear bound constraints, $L(x)=\textnormal{Diag}(x)$, where $\textnormal{Diag}(x)$ denotes the diagonal matrix with $x$ on the diagonal.  For second-order cone constraints, $L(x)=\textnormal{Arw}(x)$ where we define $\textnormal{Arw}(x)$ as
$$
        \textnormal{Arw}\left(\begin{bmatrix}x_0\\\bar{x}\end{bmatrix}\right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
        x_0 & \bar{x}^T\\\bar{x} & x_0 I
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
For semidefinite constraints, we can either define that $L(X)=X$ or that $L(X)=\frac{X\cdot + \cdot X}{2}$.  Generally, it is preferable to use the first definition since $L(X)^{-1}=X^{-1}$.  In the second case, Optizelle requires the solution of the Sylvester equations.

\subsection{barr}

        The function \texttt{barr} denotes the barrier function used by the merit function.  Optizelle requires a function so that
$$
    x\circ \nabla \textnormal{barr}(x) = e.
$$
For linear bound constraints, this is simply the log-barrier function
$$
    \textnormal{barr}(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \log(x_i).
$$
For second-order cone constraints, we define this as
$$
    \textnormal{barr}\left(\begin{bmatrix}x_0\\\bar{x}\end{bmatrix}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \log(x_0^2-\langle \bar{x},\bar{x}\rangle).
$$
For semidefinite constraints, we define this as
$$
    \textnormal{barr}(X)=\log(\textnormal{det}(X))
$$
where $\textnormal{det}(X)$ denotes the determinant of $X$.

\subsection{srch}

        The function \texttt{srch} denotes the search function used to maintain strict feasibility with respect to the inequality constraint.  We define this as
$$
    \textnormal{srch}(x,y)=\arg\max\limits_{\alpha\geq 0} \{ \alpha\in\re : \alpha x + y \succeq 0\}
$$
where we assume $y\succ 0$.  Hence, $\alpha$ denotes the maximum distance Optizelle can move in the direction $x$ from $y$ so that $\alpha x + y$ remains feasible.

\subsection{symm}

        The function \texttt{symm} denotes the symmetrization operator.  Optizelle requires this operator since we relax the commutativity requirement from the Euclidean-Jordan algebra.  For linear bound constraints and second-order cone constraints, this operation does nothing.  In addition, for semidefinite constraints where $X\circ Y=\frac{XY+YX}{2}$, this operation does nothing.  However, for semidefinite constraints where $X\circ Y=XY$, Optizelle requires $\textnormal{symm}(X)=\frac{X+X^T}{2}$.
