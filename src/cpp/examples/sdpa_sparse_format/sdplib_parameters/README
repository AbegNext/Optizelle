This directory contains several parameters designed to solve problems
found in SDPLIB 2.1 from Brian Borchers.  These parameters are not
optimal, but should demonstrate how to succesfully solve a variety
of linear SDP problems.  The test problem set can be found here:

and a paper describing the problems can be found at:
